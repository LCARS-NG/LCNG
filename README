LCNG is a LCARS-NG theme for Drupal 6 by G. Nguyen. It's originally based on the sub-theme GENESIS. This theme was inspired from the Star Trek (TNG) LCARS graphical user interface. 

LCARS-NG is an acronym for "LIBRARY COMPUTER ACCESS/RETRIEVAL SYSTEM â€“ NEXT GENERATION"

INSTALL

HELP
The frontpage of this theme is a user login page to access LCARS-NG by design. You can add a link to a custom frontpage for public users in the template file "page-front-anonymous.tpl.php".

Use the browser zoom function to scale the content to fit your screen size. In the future LCNG will optimize for different display size.
